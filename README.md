# CE2_Bernhard_Josia_Nico
This is the Class exercise 2 of Bernhard, Nico and Josia for the Data Mining in R class of spring 2024

Our Tasks are:
1) Register to the Guardian API and get the API key. 
2) Create a corpus of articles of choice following your instinct and interests.
3) Once you created your corpus, make a basic application of choice. 

Our Hypothesis is:
The decline of articles on the topic of covid-19 goes along with a rise in articles on the topic of the russian invasion on ukraine.
